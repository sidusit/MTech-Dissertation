# Novel methods to predict top nifty stocks using machine learning

# MTech-Dissertation
This repository contains the required code files for mtech data science and engineering dissertation project on novel methods for indian stock market prediction.

Codes are named as .ipynb files .<br>
Dataset are present inside Dataset/Indian folder.

# Summary
The baseline version uses only historical data to make its predictions
The mid-semester or end-semester(final) versions use comprehensive set of datasets i.e. historical data, stock indices, technical indicators, company performance, gdp, cpi etc.
The mid-semester / end-semester results are better than baseline versions used in the field. 
Hence the inclusion of macro ecnomic indicators or market behaviour helps in improving the stock predictions.

# How to run

## Baseline Results
Codes to reproduce baseline results are
1. EDA_DataPreprocess_v1.ipynb
2. ARIMA_v1.ipynb
3. DL_v2.ipynb <br>
Datasets for baseline codes are present in the Dataset/Indian/StockPrice directory. So, change the old location during data read.

## Midsemester results
Codes to reproduce mid-semester results are
1. 1_EDA_DataPreprocess_v2.ipynb
2. 2_Model_DL_v2.ipynb

## Endsemester results
Codes to reproduce end-semester results are

# TCS
Use the version used in midsemester, although data preparation on comprehensive set was done using code below.
1. 1_EDA_DataPreprocess_1_TCS_v3.ipynb
2. The best model can be obtained by running 2_Model_DL_v2.ipynb

# HDFC
Use the version used in midsemester, although data preparation on comprehensive set was done using code below.
1. 1_EDA_DataPreprocess_1_TCS_v3.ipynb
2. The best model can be obtained by running 2_Model_DL_v2.ipynb

# MARUTI
1. 1_EDA_DataPreprocess_1_MARUTI_v3.ipynb
2. 2_Model_DL_MARUTI_v7.ipynb

# HINDUNILVR
1. 1_EDA_DataPreprocess_1_HINDUNILVR_v3.ipynb
2. 2_Model_DL_HINDUNILVR_v8.ipynb

## Auxiliary Codes
All the codes apart from the ones used to produce baseline, midsemester or endsemester results are
